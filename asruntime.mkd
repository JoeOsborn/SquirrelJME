# SquirrelJME As A Runtime

There are two portions of SquirrelJME, the _SquirrelJME Virtual Machine_ and
the _SquirrelJME Runtime_. The virtual machine is the one which executes the
program and provides an environment that runs on the operating system or
other bare hardware. The runtime is the class libraries which provide a
standard set of classes and interfaces which are used by Java programs. This
document describes the requirements which are needed to have a virtual machine
which can use the SquirrelJME runtime.

Note that **J2ME** was renamed to **Java ME**, so any mentions of **Java ME**
retroactively mentions **J2ME**.

There are two cases where the runtime is used, those two cases are _pure_ and
_hosted_. There are two major differences between the two:

 * _pure_
   * All of the classes in the runtime are solely provided by SquirrelJME.
   * More consistent.
   * Portability is increased because there is less code to be ported.
   * More likely to be less complicated.
   * Requires more implementation work
 * _hosted_
   * Runs an extra SquirrelJME APIs on top of an existing virtual machine.
   * Hacks will be required for correct operation to match the semantics of
     Java ME.
   * May have compatibility issues.
   * Requires maintaining two separate programs.
   * Faster to implement non-provided APIs, there is no need to implement the
     core APIs because the host environment provides them.
   * Does not need a virtual machine to be modified to support SquirrelJME.

SquirrelJME operates in one of two fashions: _Single Program Mode_ where only
a single program is ran at once which eventually terminates, and
_Launcher Mode_ where a launcher is available and multiple programs can be
launched and ran at the same time.

 * _Single Program Mode_
   * Simple to implement, only need to worry about a single program running at
     a time.
   * Not possible to run other programs.
   * Class initialization and static initialization is easier.
 * _Launcher Mode_
   * Potentially allows JARs to be loaded at run-time to run other programs.
   * Provides an interface for selecting JARs to be ran.
   * Allows multiple programs to be ran at the same time.
   * Requires that different program execution domains be supported, this is
     because static variables need to be initialized for each program.

# Requirements of Java ME

Java ME is different from Java SE and operates in a slightly different
fashion. However, every conforming Java SE JVM can run Java ME programs but
the same is not possible in most cases because Java ME is a subset of Java SE.

## JAR Resource Lookup

When using `Class.getResourceAsStream()` in Java ME, there is a strict method
in how resource lookup is performed. A single JAR is considered to be a single
unit where resources and classes are located. A class within one unit is not
able to access the resources in another unit. Class files should not be visible
to this method and not accessible as resources, the reason for this is that
output executables may be ROMized which would destroy the class files that
executable code is derived from.

As an example, here is a set of two JAR files:

 * _foo.jar_
   * _Foo.class_
   * _onlyinfoo.txt_
   * _inboth.txt_
 * _bar.jar_
   * _Bar.class_
   * _onlyinbar.txt_
   * _inboth.txt_

This would be the result of multiple `Class.getResourceAsStream()` calls from
each class:

 * `Foo` -> _onlyinfoo.txt_: Returns _foo.jar/onlyinfoo.txt_.
 * `Foo` -> _onlyinbar.txt_: Returns `null`.
 * `Foo` -> _inboth.txt_: Returns _foo.jar/inboth.txt_.
 * `Foo` -> _Foo.class_: Should return `null`.
 * `Foo` -> _Bar.class_: Should return `null`.
 * `Bar` -> _onlyinfoo.txt_: Returns `null`.
 * `Bar` -> _onlyinbar.txt_: Returns _bar.jar/onlyinbar.txt_
 * `Bar` -> _inboth.txt_: Returns _bar.jar/inboth.txt_.
 * `Bar` -> _Foo.class_: Should return `null`.
 * `Bar` -> _Bar.class_: Should return `null`.

This reason for this is that in each JAR, there is a resource called
_META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_. This resource is used and looked up my programs which
are MIDlets in order to obtain their application properties. It also is used
by the run-time to determine what a JAR is and what it supports.

## Class Loading And Lookup

Unlike Java SE, there are no `ClassLoaders`. Java ME operates entirely on a
single two tier approach. The first tier are classes which are built-in and
available to every program. The second tier are classes which are not
built-in and which have been loaded dynamically from the launcher. When a
class is looked up, the order is always built-in classes first. If a program is
currently being executed then it may only look up classes which exist in its
execution context. If two programs are loaded they are both in two different
execution contexts and they cannot lookup each others classes. Thus if two
JARs have the same class, it will only use the class that is in their same
JAR.

# Virtual Machine Structure

The virtual machine is structured like a micro-kernel in that there is a kernel
and each task which runs on the machine is its own process with its own
memory space.

# Required Methods

For simplicity, sanity, and portability; SquirrelJME has a very simple means to
provide support for many systems and is designed in a way to reduce the amount
of work that is required to support various systems. This means that porting
SquirrelJME will be very simple and straightforward once the base semantics of
the virtual machine are implemented.

Both kernel and user-space tasks require that system calls be made available.
This means an implementation of the
`net.multiphasicapps.squirreljme.runtime.cldc.SystemCaller` class. Regardless
for the kernel or the user-space, the `_CALLER` field must be set in
`net.multiphasicapps.squirreljme.runtime.cldc.SystemCall`. For additional
support, it is possible for `__systemCaller()` be replaced as needed to return
the appropriate instance of `SystemCaller` if the field cannot statically
be set by the virtual machine.

The kernel task is required to create an implementation of the
`net.multiphasicapps.squirreljme.runtime.kernel.Kernel` class. The actual
implementation can vary according to the required means.
The system call interface that can be used in the kernel task is an
instance of
`net.multiphasicapps.squirreljme.runtime.kernel.syscall.DirectCaller` which
is capable of calling into the kernel as needed. The `_CALLER` field is set to
this caller.

User-space tasks use IPC to communicate with the kernel process and as such the
recommended means of handling that is by implementing
`net.multiphasicapps.squirreljme.runtime.clsyscall.ClientCaller`. The `_CALLER`
field is set to this caller.
