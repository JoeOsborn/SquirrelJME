The `NCI` family seems to be better interfaces when it comes to class
representation. I can actually pull code from the class file to those in the
common code set.

The current major thing is splitting off the `CF` code so that it becomes
commonized.

It might be faster to just redo the class file code to use the new interfaces
and bring in the code as required. The end result would pretty much end up
being the same for the most part however.
