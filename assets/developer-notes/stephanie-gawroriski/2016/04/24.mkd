It might actually be faster to just start from a new base and build up from
that rather than breaking and fixing all the existing code so that interfaces
are used instead.

This should at least result in much cleaner code. Then if I need to make any
adjustments or add support for different class formats (perhaps pack200)
then I do not need to support new interfaces, just use the existing one.
