So the executable should provide information on what an executable actually
is. However with the design of Java ME, it is possible for executables to be
three things: standard JARs (Main-Class), MIDlets, and LIBlets. Of course
liblets should be listed last for example mostly because they are not
executable, however I would like allow the specification of alternative
main entry points for example. So say if a liblet has a test function or
some main interface hidden in it, the user should be able to call that
main method.

## 08:25

Another consideration is that MIDlets and LIBlets can contain multiple
programs within a single binary. So this means multiple executables that point
to the same location for example.

## 08:30

I also need to handle JAD files, although I personally would prefer it if the
information were just placed into the JAR's manifest. 

## 08:33

The kernel will have to interact with the executable system and the executable
finder so that push notifications and events can launch other midlets and
such.

## 08:50

I believe I will impose a limitation that applications and such may only
be found if they are currently active in executable finders. So for example
a class path dependency of `foo/bar.jar` would be illegal and it would attempt
to use `bar.jar` instead in any of the executable finders which exist. All
finders have to be used because some libraries could be built-in.

## 08:51

To increase some speed potential and reduce the space needed for compiled
applications being stored, JARs should only be compiled and packaged as if they
were alone. They would however require a way to detect if a dependency was
changed to trigger a recompile. The library fragments would be loaded and
linked in as required. Provided I check if dependencies are out of date I can
get away with static references and indices to classes. Libraries would have to
be compiled first. For each library compiled, it would be given static
addresses to classes and such. Then following this, the compilation will
flow up to the program being ran which would then use those static references
to do more things. This would require a non-looping dependency set however,
which is required by the virtual machine anyway. However, what would be a bit
complicated however are the three states of executables. If a JAR is a classic
application, a MIDLet, and a LIBlet it can have three distinct dependency sets.
There are also optional dependencies. Also when it comes to a JIT, it might
just take forever to compile every single class that exists in the JAR and its
dependencies. On limited systems, the user might just give up if a program is
taking forever to start because it is compiling everything for maximum speed.
So as I thought of before, I should instead of having extreme optimization of
static devise a means where I can still somewhat do it, but be able to detect
if a class dependency has changed and such. Calculating SHA-1 sums or similar
for class files will be a lengthy operation however. So I just need a nice and
faster checksum algorithm that is not an intensive operation. Those do exist.
When it comes to verification, it will be done at compile time.

## 09:06

The hashing algorithm to use would likely be MurmurHash since it is fast and
is adequite to find some collisions and changes. I could base a class file
on its hash and store it in the cache. The cache would need to store the name
of the class and its hash. There is a possibility of a class with the same name
using different hashes can exist.

## 09:27

The executable interface can provide access to raw resource and class data
somewhat. Well, actually instead I need an archive which provides access to
resources. I need this for `getResourceAsStream` and `ServiceLoader`, where
the later looks at multiple service records to find classes to use.

## 09:29

Then instead of executables, I can instead reference executables from
archives instead. So if there is a JAR which provides 3 types of programs and
say 42 different midlets in it, it would not massively clutter the programs
available. This would be good for low memory systems. So basically instead
I would have `ArchiveFinder` provided to the console interface. Then
executable finders would be attached to archives and programs would be accessed
through archives which as a group would act as a classpath. Native binaries
would also be archives but they would instead act as binaries for the most
part. However to handle differing things, the archive finder would instead have
`locateClass` and `locateResource`. Treating class files as resources would be
a bit ugly. However, for common cache-ness, `ArchiveFinder` should be an
`abstract class` instead of an `interface` so that resource locations and
classes could be cached.

## 09:35

On the start of the user interface, the archives could be scanned and cached
by the kernel for example. Then each program that is running with its set
classpath could instead use archives to reference details and such. This way
if 20 programs are running at once and they all share libraries, the libraries
only have to be in memory at a single time. However since everything would be
a library, I would need to adjust the compiler as before and not overly
optimize static values. I would have to backtrack a bit and have it so classes
can be compiled without knowing about any other class. Then that information
would have to be checked at run-time or with the interpreter. However to
remove the duplicate checking code, I can have a common class to check
details in the run-time. So basically the NCI will have this checker, however
its lookup class will be removed and not used by other places such as the
byte code. The byte code representation itself would optimize only if it knows
the details against itself. Archives can expose classes as NCIClass for example
which could be bound to real class files or native binaries which provide
internal details. So say if the CLDC is a native library and the user wants to
run a class in an interpreter, the interpreted class must be able to access
the native class details. The opposite has to be able to happen also.

## 09:43

Also to maximize memory savings when it comes to the descriptors, I should
have bulk caches of them so that multiple descriptors which share similar
string values can potentially reduce memory usage and such. There could
quite possibly be a few hundred instances of `java/lang/Object` strings
in memory at one time.

## 10:22

And now I have cached symbols, so memory can now be saved when many classes
would likely share symbols. Although slightly slower, the decreased memory
usage is a bonus. Also means that strings can be thrown away more often. I
should also `intern` NCIUTF also so that it uses a single string set. Note
that intern is managed by my own library as a WeakHashMap rather than magical
JVM specific stuff for the most part. Although intern checks if the JVM has
the string interned already.

## 10:25

Also, to the virtual machine all UTF strings are deemed to be interned anyway.

## 10:33

The `Archive` class could also manage the manifest which is used to determine
which programs an archive provides and such.

## 13:26

What I need is a way to bridge the archive to the kernel. I need actual
archive finders now.

## 14:07

Actually, I will need a somewhat better menu interface on the console UI. I
suppose first I will list archive finders which are then selected, this would
go then into the list of archives that were found. Then when an archive is
selected, it will list the available programs.

## 16:00

So currently I just have a simple going up and down a menu without selecting
anything at all.

## 16:05

I could probably use a kind of drop thread to a process from the kernel.

## 19:42

Made a number of commits this day, pretty nice. Although I have not made any
in the past few hours. Suppose a short break of sorts. I suppose for simplicity
the archives would be scanned and stored. Whenever a rescan is done the
information is potentially updated as such. This way if a new file is added it
can be rescanned and used.

I repaired my glasses rather nicely. Previously they were broken in the middle
of the bridge (which makes me quite lucky). The first time they broke I took
a paperclip across the bridge and wrapped a few wires of thin copper around it.
They initially snapped on 2015/07/10. I wrote this on another project in my
notes:

So I did essentially the same thing except instead I used thicker tinned
copper. After the initial wrapping the glasses were surprisingly sturdy even
before being soldered, while before they were shaky and had to be soldered on
a very flat surface with hot glue holding the glasses in place. So just the
better wire made things much better. I have been holding off repairing my
glasses for a month or two though. The copper wires snapped which slowly
started to cause the insides to slip around and such. I did not add electrical
tape at all though. However, as extra insurance against the pieces breaking off
the nose rest supports I wrapped some more wire around the two pieces and
soldered those in place. I just hope this soldering job lasts quite awhile
similar to my previous job. I forgot when I got these glasses however, I
probably got them around 6 years ago so they are still hanging on some. It is
difficult to get new pairs of glasses.
