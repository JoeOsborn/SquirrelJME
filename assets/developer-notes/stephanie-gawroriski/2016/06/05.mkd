There is nothing to refactor, since all code has been refactored. Perhaps I
can clone a video game and use it as a sample project. A game that would work
great using the LUI and LCDUI (in the future). Personally I alway wanted to
write my own Advance Wars clone, so I suppose I shall do that.

Having atomic bulk read/write operations would be difficult and potentially
very costly. I am also not sure of any CPU that has atomic operations that are
more than a given word size or similar.
