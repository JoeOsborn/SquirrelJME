Another day of not getting much done at all, I have been busy fixing a
computer.

## 16:49

What I can do when it comes to the test caller is have a class which has a
cached database of sorts when it comes to names. Although this might not be
needed even though allocating names every time is a bit inefficient.

## 17:17

I could merge the test name and default test group for the most part.

## 17:20

Instead of two methods, one for the name and the default tests, they can be
combined into one.

## 17:56

For specific test regions I can use try with resources.

## 18:22

Co-dependencies would definitely be useful.

## 19:06

So now I have a base refactor of the test interfaces, I just now need to
implement them. Currently the new test interfaces are much better than before.
Then with an abstract `TestCaller` I can have different means of test
reporting.
