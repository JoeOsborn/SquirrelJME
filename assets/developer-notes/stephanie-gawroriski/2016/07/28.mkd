Going to continue working on my mascot.

I did finish the head, and I have part of the right foot done. This does give
me experience for working on a logo. My idea for a logo is to have the _q_
have a tail that flows under and becomes the _l_. Then **Squirrel** is made
fuzzy.

Completed the right leg.
