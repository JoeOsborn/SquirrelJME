New month, I must select a color.

Was distracted a bit today. I do wonder though if the kernel should be
directly associated with a project manager or JAR resources. There will
be JARs which are internally included in the executable potentially.

It would probably be best to have an interface that provides methods which
give interfaces rather than have a single interface used. Or `Kernel` can
just be abstract.
