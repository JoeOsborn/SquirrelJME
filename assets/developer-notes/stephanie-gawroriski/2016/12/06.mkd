Actually what I can do for namespaces is have a base class for namespaces
which also handles the loading of project manifests as needed. Then this
base namespace group can initialize the information needed for projects. I
suppose what I could do instead is remerge the split off manifests which I
have done and revert that to use single manifests again.
