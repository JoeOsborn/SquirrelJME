I will need some initial state.

I could also use a kind of state machine accessor to the JIT that is initiated
with the translation engine. That way there is a backwards bridge of sorts to
the current code decoder, this will be very useful. It could either be in a
new class, or the current class can implement an interface. However, using it
as a `CodeDescriptionStream` could be as useful as it is dangerous.
