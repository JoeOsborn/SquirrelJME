Seems my allocated registers are not being stored.

So for method invocation, this means storing saved registers that are
currently being used to stack positions. Temporaries are saved by
the caller, while saved are saved by the callee. So the invoke has to
go through the method and store any argument registers (I will treat
them as temporary) and additionally save the argument registers.
