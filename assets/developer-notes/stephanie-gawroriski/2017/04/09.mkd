So far this new code is much much simpler such as the handling attributes. I
had the code previously all over the place. In reality only a single attribute
is handled for fields and methods and that is how I handle that. I just need
to get back into the parsing the byte code. So I then have to consider my
previous plans. Having an intermediate language would be the best choice
because it could be optimized along with generating the native machine code.
