So since I work I have less to work on SquirrelJME, but every little bit
counts.

And it definitely counts. This new refactor of the code seems much easier
and simpler to write and is not a giant complete mess. Hopefully it keeps
being really nice.

Definitely much better this time around. Also I will just have exceptions
always visible rather than not being visible.
