Ok, so push/pop will be in the state. Not in any tread to simplify things.
Also it should make things much easier. I also will have a pushNew and a
pushCopy. Basically push copy will have an input tread source and such
derived from the slot.

I think it would be easiest if locals were never aliased. That would make
exception handling a bit better.

Looks like I am putting variables which should be in locals on the stack
instead.
