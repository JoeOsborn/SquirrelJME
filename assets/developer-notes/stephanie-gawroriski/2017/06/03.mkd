So hopefully this new laptop I will be getting works quite well and has not
been damaged during shipping. I do wonder on its feature set, it seems to
be a model with all the optionals included which would be a very nice thing
since that would make things better and easier to work with. I think what I
can do once I set it up is make a video of what I have and make a presentation
of sorts on SquirrelJME.
