Setting up new laptop, so hopefully my code productivity increases because it
will be faster and I will not need to wait for the compiler to run. Results
should come pretty fast and such. I can also multitask better also.

Laptop should be fully setup now, also was doing other things today so was
unable to get any programming down. Perhaps tomorrow I can do so I hope.
