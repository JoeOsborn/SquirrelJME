Ok so for class validity and such I can have a checked thing I suppose in the
link table which verifies that conditions are met. Basically I am going to
need two tables an import table and an export table. When compilation
completes the import table will be checked to make sure that all exports are
met and they will be bound together.

So I need to figure out the best way to represent classes which are in the
link table.
