I wonder if constructors start always with the uninitialized this in the
stack map table rather than having an initialized this.

Ok, so the verifier section has this information. It has unitialized
variables which are created by new which then need initialization.

It would be best to have distinct tops for long/double so that there is no
confusion as to what the values are associated with.
