One thing I will need to consider are `String`s, the best way to store them in
a memory optimized form. I think a general thing is that strings will never
use more than a given count of characters. My plan is to use `byte` arrays and
instead have it where 0-127 are normal ASCII values which are plain, but then
have 128-255 be a mapped set of characters. This would reduce the speed a bit
but it would potentially reduce characters used. Reading characters would
require accessing the map. Probably in most cases, any strings that appear
most of them will be pure ASCII, never triggering a map ever. The map itself
would need to be backed by a `char` array if it exists, since it would handle
characters outside of the ASCII range in most cases. I will say that most
methods within `String` must use `charAt`.
