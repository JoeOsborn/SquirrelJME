Actually, loading every single class that exists is more optimized because I
can do basic inlining of methods that are really simple (like methods which
just return a field value) and I can also read the value of final fields which
have a known value at compile time. So basically I can produce better code and
have a simpler JIT and linking stage because those randoms and unknown that
come from before would be less complicated because now there would be less of
them.
