Okay so for the profiles the best thing to do would be to have it where...
Well for the `ProvidedInfo` it does not really make sense for profiles to
be alone. The best thing to do would be to group them by API name and then

be like: `Map<APIName, SuiteVersions>`. I can make a special class for that
which keeps them sorted and such.
