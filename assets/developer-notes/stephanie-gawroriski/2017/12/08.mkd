Okay so the pipe based communication between the system task and client tasks
will be done by a new class I created: `PacketStream`. That class will just
have a common implementation. The first use would be it being used by the
Java SE host to communicate to sub-processes. Then later on when user-space
stuff comes along, it will be used for that communication as needed.
