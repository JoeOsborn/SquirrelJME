An issue in Java 9 will be that `newInstance()` has been deprecated so the
main interface that I use will be potentially be unable to be used in the
future for Java. So basically one thing which will be important to do would
be to have a virtual machine which runs Java SE which I do not have to worry
about losing support from a mainstream system.
