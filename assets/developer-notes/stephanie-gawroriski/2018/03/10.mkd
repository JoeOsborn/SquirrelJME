Okay so what I need is a new enumeration to specify the class flags and such
instead of using the one for the class file because there are inner flags
and such that need to be considered. Also stuff like `strictfp` on classes
is completely virtual. Additionally there are no static classes in the VM,
so I suppose now I should work on a kind of compiler based class structure.
