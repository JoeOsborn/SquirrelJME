# Wide variety of libraries

Linux offers an extremely wide variety of libraries and C runtimes. SquirrelJME
will have to detect the correct C library and use it accordingly. This would
for example be better than using systems calls and such. For example, using
`gethostbyname` with a system call directly would not use the libraries listed
in `/etc/nsswitch.conf` which would be bad for integration. However, C
libraries are potentially not 100% compatible with each other, so this would
be interesting to figure out. Generally though for architectures, the C
libraries should hopefully be compatible with each other. As an idea, I can
wrap and catch errors made in the standard library for example if calling
some code crashes, I can catch the signal for say segmentation fault and then
just generate an exception for it.
