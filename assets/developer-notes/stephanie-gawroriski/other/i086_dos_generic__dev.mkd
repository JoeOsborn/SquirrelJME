# Intel 8086: DOS Family

Everyone's favorite 16-bit protected mode operating system.

# Cooperative Tasking

DOS has no threads, it even has no processes. Thus everything will be
multi-tasked.

# TSRs?

It is possible to have a fork in the background TSR running which runs the
JVM code. However that would be rather complex, although something similar
would be done with Palm OS.
