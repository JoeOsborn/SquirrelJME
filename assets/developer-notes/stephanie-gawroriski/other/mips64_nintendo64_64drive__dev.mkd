# MIPS 64-bit: Nintendo 64 (64drive)

# Either 4MiB or 8MiB

The expansion pack doubles the system memory so it can store twice, at the cost
of potentially messing up the GameShark usage.

# SD/CF Support

Flash carts may provide access to CF and/or SD cards, this can be used for
loading JARs which are not internal to the ROM.
