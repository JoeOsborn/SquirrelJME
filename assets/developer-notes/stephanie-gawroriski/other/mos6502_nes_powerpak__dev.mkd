# MOS Technology 6502: Nintendo Entertainment System

The NES is Nintendo's first real console that everyone really know about.

# Target the PowerPak

Since the PowerPak is the most common flash cart which is available, it should
be the target. This way the code can run on native NES systems, otherwise it
would not be a novelty.

## Limitations

The PowerPak on the NES has the following space limits:

 * 512KiB Program
 * 512KiB CHR
 * 32KiB Battery RAM

The NES has the following limitations:

 * 2KiB RAM

# Graphics

The NES has a very limited means for drawing graphics. When it comes to the
background, everything is an 8x8 tile. I would like to have pixel level
control and have a framebuffer, so this likely means that there would need to
be quite a number of tiles which make much pixels. For all possible pixel
combinations I would need 4,096 tile for each unique combination of tiles.
However if I instead reduce the resolution by half, they all fit.
