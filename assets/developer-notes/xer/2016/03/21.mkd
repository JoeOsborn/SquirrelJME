Actually, when it comes to what a specific kind of register is I can have it
variable as needed. For example, I might not need 64 integer registers, but
I might need 72 floating point registers. Then at least I will have a more
Java purposed instruction set so to speak. I can have 5 types of registers:

 * int
 * long
 * float
 * double
 * reference

## 00:06

Then this way I will have a better means and will not be exactly locked into
how registers are used.

The interpreter due to the refactor no longer needs the full CLDC and now just
relies on the compact one.

## 10:58

Hopefully this intermediate language works out and stays compact. I suppose
as a first step, the byte code is translated literally to NARF and then
following that it is compacted and such.

I need to simplify the build manifests and generate them as required for
dependencies to fill out the `Class-Path` and the LIBlet/MIDlet dependencies.
I currently just have this information duplicated but it could be handled by
the build system. I also have enough of a layout where I can build a simple
build system in Java and then use `build.sh` as a bootstrap to it.

## 16:41

Actually the build system is just going to have some duplicate code, so I
should fix that case.

## 17:31

`DirectoryStream` is not recursive, that explains a few things.

## 23:57

Refactored build system is nice, and perhaps tommorrow I shall get support for
building on Windows, which should be very simple.
