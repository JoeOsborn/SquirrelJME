So after some days of being busy in real life to do things, I finished the
class file refactor for the most part.

    1860    javame-class-file java=1860
    1074    native-compiler-class-interface java=1074
    684     native-compiler-class-file java=684

The javame-class-file project was essentially split into two parts. As
individual units they are much simpler than before.
