The PVM would likely be better just using the FS Jar ClassUnit provider.

## 09:23

The `ClassUnitProvider` is best an abstract class so that I can have common
functionality declared within it.

Methods that match the descriptors of those in `Object` and are final will
need to be replaced in definition so that they do not conflict at all. Since
all objects extend `Object` this means any method calls performed on the
`final` methods that cannot be replaced must be wrapped somehow on load and
on referencing.

Only a single JAR gets placed in the class path.

What I need now is a class file writer, one that can be given information and
byte code and write it to an output array of sorts. Although not going to the
disk, the written classes will be used by the `PVMClassLoader` to load the
virtualized classes.

Today is summer.
