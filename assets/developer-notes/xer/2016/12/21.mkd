For simplicity, opening directories should be very direct until they are
closed rather than having reference counting and hoping that something
does get closed. It would potentially increase memory usage, but in most
cases the contents of projects will not need to be open all the time
except when used by the interpreter. This makes the system a bit more
sane and easier to implement (since I do not need to worry about
references and keeping the cache active).
