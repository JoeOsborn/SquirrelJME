I should have a more simplified triplet or machine identification system.
Right now I have the JIT stuff and I also have the native code. I believe
this has to be simplified a bit. Perhaps instead of indentifying some
things in triplets, they can just be by class. On other hand, the targets
can be hard coded or essentially share much of the code. Maybe it would be
best to not have configuration files for some targets beyond a basic
level.
