So the execution flow control is actually really ugly. This information should
be in the cards. I would say that instead of having the nexts and jump targets
which is quite ugly, there are insertion points. The only thing is that
aliases cannot alias if they are targets for a back jump. So I will need some
kind of jump target barriers.
