So I had this idea of having special basic block zones which are not mapped
to instruction ranges. This would be used for the synchronized enter and exit
along with potential exception handler checkers. So this would mean that there
is a class used as a specifier for the range. So `BasicBlockZone` does not use
instructions, but rather a key which is used in the map.
