# Motorolla 68000: Palm OS

# Cooperative or Preemptive?

I do know that Palm OS 5 is preemptive, however I do not know about older
versions of Palm OS. However I believe older versions of Palm OS are
cooperative with some interrupts for non-cooperative callbacks. Palm OS
will essentially freeze if a program handles the event loop incorrectly or
does not give the OS a chance to perform work.

# Alarms

Alarms could be used if there is no preemptive multi-tasking to simulate a
preemptive call. Basically when an alarm is called it can launch the program
which then performs the proper dispatching and such.
