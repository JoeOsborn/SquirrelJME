# PowerPC 32-bit: MorphOS

This is an Amiga OS clone.

# Time Limit

The OS has an effective time limit of 30 minutes, which will make long
debugging sessions difficult to work with. However, purchasing a license
for around 200 USD will remove said time limit. As such, Amiga OS and PowerPC
support would generally be before this.
